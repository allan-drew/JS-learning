// HTML events are "things" that happen to HTML elements.

// JavaScript lets you execute code when events are detected.
// Here are some examples of HTML events:
    // An HTML button was clicked
    // An HTML web page has finished loading
    // An HTML input field was changed

// When JavaScript is used in HTML pages, JavaScript can "react" on these events.

// <element event="some JavaScript">
//      ||   ||         ||
//      ||   ||         ||
//      ||   ||         ||
//      \/   \/         \/
// <button onclick="document.getElementById('demo').innerHTML = Date()">The time is?</button>
